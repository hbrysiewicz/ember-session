## Building Ember Session
Ember Session uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as a build system,
These two libraries will need to be installed before building.

To build Ember Session, clone the repository, and run `npm install` to install build dependencies
and `grunt` to build the library.

Unminified and minified builds of Ember Session will be placed in the `dist`
directory.
